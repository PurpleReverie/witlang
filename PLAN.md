# Wit — project plan

The comprehensive plan for the Wit project: vision, architecture, milestones, user stories, dev stories, TDD stories (utility / state / composition), open design questions, risks, and operational concerns.

Companion to `wit-spec.pdf` (canonical language reference) and `examples/` (narrative feature introduction).

---

## A. Vision & scope

### What Wit is at v1.0

- A parser library (TypeScript) that takes `.wit` source and returns a typed, source-located AST.
- A small runtime (resolver + expander) that resolves references and inlines definitions.
- A reference renderer (HTML).
- A VS Code extension with semantic highlighting and minimal LSP (errors, hover, go-to-definition).
- A test corpus that locks language behavior — the executable spec.
- Documentation: the spec PDF (canonical), narrative examples (`examples/`), and an introductory guide.

### Non-goals

- Wit reserves a small core vocabulary mirroring HTML's semantic shapes (headings, lists, links, images, tables, sections, etc.). Renderers commit to handling these faithfully. Beyond the core, writers define their own vocabulary with `#name`. For renderer-specific extensions (custom React components, mapboxes, game-state widgets), `@node(...)` is the opaque pass-through that carries params straight to the renderer.
- Not Turing-complete on its own. `<% %>` is the explicit escape hatch for general computation.
- Not a templating engine for arbitrary string interpolation.
- Not a CMS or authoring environment. Wit is a file format.
- Not an inline rich-text editor language.

## B. Audiences

| Audience | Primary concern | Surface they touch |
|---|---|---|
| Writer | Stay in prose; structure visible but unobtrusive | Surface syntax only |
| Author-programmer | Composability, predictable expansion, debuggability | Definitions, data, control flow, scripting |
| Renderer author | Stable AST, query helpers, source locations | AST + `lh` bridge |
| Tool author | Error model, serializable AST, fast reparse | Parser API, error types |
| Integrator | Minimal deps, deterministic output, versioning | Library packaging |

---

## C. Architecture

Five stages, each independently testable and replaceable:

```
source string
   ↓ Lexer            tokens with source locations
   ↓ Parser           raw AST (invocations unresolved)
   ↓ Resolver         bound AST (every @x linked to its #x)
   ↓ Expander         expanded AST (definitions inlined, conditions/loops evaluated)
   ↓ Renderer         output (HTML / JSON / typeset / game tree)
```

**Rationale.** Renderers consume any post-Expander AST. Tools that only need structure (LSP, formatters) stop after Parser or Resolver — they don't need expansion. Each stage is independently testable.

**Source locations** propagate through every stage. Every AST node carries `{ file, line, col, length }`.

### Module layout

```
packages/
  parser/          lexer, parser, AST types, errors
  runtime/         resolver, expander, lh bridge
  render-html/     reference renderer
  vscode/          extension + LSP server
  cli/             wit build / wit parse / wit check
tests/
  fixtures/        .wit + .json snapshot pairs
  integration/     whole-document tests
  errors/          .wit + .err.json pairs
  runner/          vitest harness
```

### Resolution timing

Lexer/parser/resolver/expander each act on a defined token-class set. The table below pins which stage handles which class.

| Stage | Name | Constructs | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Eager (resolve stage) | Pipe values, parens slots, record RHS, conditional operands (outside definition bodies), `(each)` iteration heads, top-level prose access | Resolver computes the value once and binds it. |
| 2 | Expansion-time (expander stage) | Definition body interpolation, definition body conditionals against `::param::` (R3), captured-value substitution | Re-resolved per invocation. |
| 3 | Snapshot (iteration stage) | The collection expression inside `(each @x as item)` | Evaluated eagerly at iteration entry, then the resulting sequence is frozen for the duration of the loop. Loop body access against `@item` uses the snapshot. |

Composition:

- A definition whose body contains an `(each)` over a captured collection: the capture binds eagerly at invocation (stage 1); the `(each)` snapshots the captured value at entry (stage 3); body iteration uses the snapshot.
- A pipe value containing an access path that resolves to a collection: eager evaluation produces the collection reference, which is then frozen if iterated.

### Core vocabulary

A small reserved set of node names ships with the language. The
resolver does NOT require a `#def` for these names, and renderers
commit to mapping them to faithful semantic output. They mirror
HTML's semantic shapes.

| Group | Names |
|---|---|
| Headings | `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6` |
| Inline | `em`, `strong`, `code`, `u`, `s`, `sub`, `sup`, `mark`, `small`, `br` |
| Lists | `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `dl`, `dt`, `dd` |
| Link + media | `a` (href, target), `img` (src, alt, width, height), `figure`, `figcaption`, `audio`, `video` |
| Tables | `table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tfoot`, `tr`, `th`, `td`, `caption` |
| Blocks | `p`, `blockquote`, `pre`, `hr` |
| Sectioning | `section`, `article`, `aside`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `main` |
| Other | `cite` |

In addition, `@node` is a universal opaque pass-through. Resolver
skips binding lookup; the expander emits the NodeUse intact with all
params, so renderers can dispatch on the `type` param (convention,
not a reserved word). User-defined wrappers compose naturally:

```
#highlight ||content||
@node(type highlight) ::content:: node@
highlight#

@highlight Some text highlight@
```

### D.1 — VS Code extension roadmap (post-M5 core)

The M5 core has shipped in `packages/vscode`: TextMate grammar + semantic
tokens, push diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition, references, document
symbols (outline/breadcrumbs), completion (trigger chars `@ # : .`), a
cross-file reference index, and a `language-configuration.json`
(brackets, comments, auto-close). The items below are committed future
work, grouped by effort. Most reuse infrastructure that already exists —
the parser, runtime, `render-html`/`render-markdown`, and the cross-file
reference index — so they are about exposing existing capability to the
editor rather than new engine work.

**Quick wins (config / manifest only)**

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Word-wrap default for `.wit` | `contributes.configurationDefaults` → `"[wit]": { "editor.wordWrap": "on" }`. Ships wrap-on to every install; users can still override. |
| Live HTML preview panel | Webview, side-by-side like Markdown preview, auto-refresh on save/change, backed by `@witlang/render-html`. Highest value-per-effort. Architecture: `docs/universal-render-target.md`. |
| Snippets | `.code-snippets` for the five preferred forms: value-block def `#name: … !!`, record-arg `@x { k: v }`, colon scatter, block-form def `#name … name#`, bare reference. Scaffolds correct idiom. |
| Code folding | Fold `#name … name#`, `#name: … !!`, and `@x … x@` regions — `folding.markers` in `language-configuration.json` or a `foldingRangeProvider`. |
| File icon | Wire up the existing `icons/wit-file-icon.svg` via an `iconThemes` contribution so `.wit` files get the custom explorer icon. |
| Palette commands | Wrap the CLI: "Wit: Render to HTML / Markdown", "Wit: Check", "Wit: Tour". |

**Medium (LSP additions that reuse the existing index)**

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Document links | Make `reference ./shared/schema.wit` paths Ctrl-clickable — `documentLinkProvider`. |
| Rename symbol | Rename a def and update every `@ref`; mostly wiring over the existing references index — `renameProvider`. |
| Workspace symbol search | Cmd-T across all defs in the workspace; the cross-file index already exists — `workspaceSymbolProvider`. |
| Signature help | Show expected params as a node call is filled, leveraging v0.2.0 typed params — `signatureHelpProvider`. |
| Code actions / quick fixes | "convert pipes → record-arg", "extract selection → value-block def", "close unclosed node", fix for the W-6 partial-mismatch diagnostic. Actively steers toward preferred forms. |
| Style / lint diagnostics | Flag the documented anti-patterns: pipes outside mid-body switching, content carried in params. |

**Bigger bets**

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Formatter / format-on-save | `documentFormattingProvider` (or a `wit fmt` CLI) that normalizes invocation forms and form-fill indentation. |
| Embedded script highlighting | Inject the JS/TS grammar inside `<% %>` blocks so the script bridge gets real highlighting. |
| Custom editor / notebook view | A true split source + rendered editor for `.wit`. Most ambitious. |
| Task provider | `wit check` as a build task with a problem matcher. |
| Marketplace publish | Currently dev-install only (`pnpm vscode:install`); package the VSIX and publish. Ties into M7. |

**Priority (value-per-effort):** live preview → snippets → folding +
file icon → document links → rename.

### D.2 — Literal nodes, interpolation & components (in progress)

A literal-content layer that builds toward a component system. **Shipped**
(working tree): `@@name … name@@` literal nodes and `@@@…@@@` frozen bodies;
`{{path}}` interpolation inside `@@` bodies (single braces stay literal, so
CSS works); `style`/`script` raw-text rendering + custom CSS in the default
render path; VS Code 0.4.0 grammar. **Designed, not yet built**: the `body`
param (+ `@@` ≡ `body:` literal), the `##name … name##` literal-node def,
`{{}}` in strings and normal content, capture scope + param defaults, and
component-CSS dedup. Full model, build order, and open bugs:
`docs/literal-nodes-and-components.md`.

## I. Open design questions

Each must be resolved during M1 (driven by fixture writing).

1. Are comments AST nodes or fully elided?
2. Single newline within a paragraph — collapse to space, or preserve as a soft break?
3. Where can `@name.field` access appear — only in statements/params, or also in body prose? Boundary rule?
4. Parameter values — always unquoted, or quoted for special-char values?
   **I.4 — RESOLVED (backslash escape).** Inside parameter values (pipes and parens), backslash escapes the four reserved chars: `\|`, `\,`, `\!`, `\\` (literal backslash). Outside those four contexts, backslash is literal. No quoting syntax. Rationale: matches programmer expectations, simple state-machine, avoids smart-quote ambiguity.
5. Numeric literals in records — distinguished type, or just strings?
6. Bare reference vs prose: where does `@weil` end? Whitespace? Punctuation?
7. `!!` greedy-parse risk in body prose. Options:
   - **A.** Context-only — `!!` only terminates when a recognized opener is active.
   - **B.** Always reserved — escape with `\!!` to use as prose punctuation.
   - **C.** Position-restricted — `!!` legal only at end-of-line or before whitespace.
8. Forward references — `@x` before `#x`? Lean yes (hoisted definitions).
9. Definition scope — file-local or merged across references? Lean global within reference graph.
10. `lh.set(...)` and immutability — mutate AST or layered overlay?
11. Mixing parens and pipes on same node — error, or merge?
12. Multi-word flags via parens: `@badge(full width!)` — whole flag or single word?
13. `@scriptCall(fn)` — builtin or generic? Calling convention?
14. Source locations across additive partials — file-tagged child nodes?
15. Indentation in records / collections — required for multi-line or cosmetic?
16. Short-close `!!`: inline-only, or block-allowed?
17. Combining `!!` close with parens (`@name(p, q) body !!`) — allowed?

### Lifted from M1 fixture _notes.md (M1.review)

#### Lexical / whitespace / line endings
18. Whitespace-only line: paragraph boundary or content? (00-lexical)
19. Trailing newlines at EOF: one empty paragraph, many, or none? (00-lexical)
20. Newline normalization order — pre-lex CR/CRLF/LF normalization vs after splitting? (00-lexical)
21. Empty `.wit` input: empty document, error, or single empty paragraph? (00-lexical)
22. No-trailing-LF policy: require, synthesize, or accept? (00-lexical)
23. Leading whitespace on prose lines: strip, preserve, or normalize tabs? (00-lexical)

#### Emphasis word-boundary
24. Word-character class for `_`/`*` emphasis flanking — `[A-Za-z0-9]` lean; Unicode policy unresolved. (02-emphasis)
25. Empty marks `__` / `**` — literal text, error, or empty-emphasis node? (02-emphasis)
26. Three-or-more adjacent mark chars (`***x***`, `_**x**_`) — precedence rule. (02-emphasis)
27. Smart-quote substitution policy at apostrophe boundaries. (01-prose, 02-emphasis)

#### Comments
28. Comment-line as paragraph joiner vs separator vs transparent — see I.1 + I.2 composite. (03-comments)
29. Comment trivia ownership: who owns leading/trailing whitespace? (03-comments)
30. Whitespace-after-tilde for line comment: single space, any horizontal whitespace, or any non-word? (03-comments)
31. Block comment crossing blank line: legal or not? (03-comments)
32. Internal `~~` divider preservation policy (verbatim bytes or split-into-tokens). (03-comments)
33. Empty block comment `~~ ~~/` and tight `~~~~/`: legality and node shape. (03-comments)

#### Identifier / handle character class
34. Handle character class formally: `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, first char letter; trailing-hyphen disallowed. (04-nodes-use)
35. Handle case-sensitivity: exact-match vs case-fold. Lean exact. (04-nodes-use)
36. Handle Unicode policy: ASCII-only / NFC-normalised / UAX #31. (04-nodes-use, 07-definitions)
    **I.36 — RESOLVED for v1.0 (ASCII-only).** Handle character class is `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`. Non-ASCII handles (`@café`, `@日本`) are reserved for v2 via opt-in mode. Rationale: simpler lexer, no Unicode normalization at parse time, matches M1.04's concrete proposal. v2 will add an opt-in `wit.config` flag to relax the class.
37. Leading-underscore handle (`@_private`): allowed or not. (04-nodes-use)
38. Digit-before-`@` boundary (`agent007@…`): non-NodeUse-opener, parity with letter-before. (16-ambiguity)

#### Parens parameter form (05)
39. Empty `()` form: legal as `Param[] = []` with `ParamSource='parens'` vs equivalent to bare `@x`. (05-nodes-parens)
40. Parens trailing-comma policy (`@x(a,)`): tolerated, no empty slot. (05-nodes-parens)
41. Inner-whitespace normalization inside parens slots — strip per slot, parity with pipes. (05-nodes-parens)
42. Hyphen-as-separator rule (` - ` with surrounding spaces); literal hyphen in identifier. (05-nodes-parens, 06-parameters-pipes)
43. Parens self-closing classification: standalone-line=block, mid-prose=inline (parity with 4.S.2). (05-nodes-parens)
44. Parens-then-body shape (`@aside(...) body aside@`): error vs explicit-closer-overrides. (05-nodes-parens)

#### Pipe parameter form (06)
45. Bare positional vs flag: single-word no-`!` is positional. (06-parameters-pipes)
46. Last-one-wins scope for named pipes: node-scoped; positional appended (no dedup). (06-parameters-pipes)
47. Empty `||` semantics in body vs capture-list opener context — body=error, capture-list=reserved. (06-parameters-pipes)
48. Pipe-shaped text mid-prose: position-sensitive slot recognition (slot only at expected positions). (06-parameters-pipes)
49. Mid-body pipe scatter: parse collects all, resolver applies last-one-wins per key (two-pass). (06-parameters-pipes)
50. Multi-word key delimiter: first-space-or-` - ` rule, single deterministic split. (06-parameters-pipes)

#### Definitions (07)
51. Interpolation `::name::` context-only (inside definition body); literal elsewhere. (07-definitions)
52. Capture-list shape: `||a, b||` legal only in definition opener; body `||` errors. (07-definitions)
53. Empty capture list `||||`: equivalent to no capture list. (07-definitions)
54. Capture-name character class — parity with handle class. (07-definitions)
55. Definition shape decided by opener byte (block / single-line / value-block); shape classifier rule (a). (07-definitions)
56. `!!` terminator trailing-whitespace tolerance and nested-definition LIFO. (07-definitions)
57. Body-slot `...` positioning: at-most-once, anywhere; literal in single-line value. (07-definitions, I.16)
58. Empty single-line value `#name: !!`: legal, value is empty string. (07-definitions)
59. Definition redefinition: error unless `+#x` additive prefix. (07-definitions)
60. Interpolation of undeclared capture: resolve-time error at `::z::` loc. (07-definitions)

#### Additive partials (08)
61. `+#name` merge stage: expand-time merge in resolver (single `NodeDef` after resolution). (08-additive-partials)
62. Merged `NodeDef.loc` policy: first contribution's loc; children carry per-contribution loc. (08-additive-partials)
63. Mix normal `#x` + additive `+#x`: base + additives compose (single base permitted). (08-additive-partials)
64. Shape compatibility across `+#x` contributions: must match across contributions; mismatch errors. (08-additive-partials)
65. `+#name` cross-file scope: shared namespace across reference graph (ratifies I.9). (08-additive-partials)
66. Captures on `+#x`: forbidden on additive contributions; signature owned by non-additive base. (08-additive-partials)
67. Bare `+#x` with no base or sibling: legal single-contribution definition. (08-additive-partials)
68. Whitespace between `+` and `#` (`+ #name`): error; prefix is exactly `+#`. (08-additive-partials)
69. Partial ordering: depth-first reference traversal, source-byte order within file. (08-additive-partials)
70. Reference de-duplication: same file referenced twice loads once. (08-additive-partials, DS-8)

#### Records / collections (09 / 10)
71. Scalar typing rule (a): signed decimal int/float → Number, lowercase `true`/`false` → Bool, else String. (09-records, 10-collections)
72. Boolean literal recognition: lowercase exact `true`/`false` only. (09-records)
73. Number recognition scope: no scientific notation / no hex / no underscores / no `Infinity`/`NaN`. (09-records)
74. Empty record-field value `{ a - }`: parse error. (09-records)
75. Comma-in-unquoted-value: comma always terminates field at brace level (forces quoting/escape for embedded commas). (09-records)
76. Hyphen-separator rule for `key - value` (parity across parens/pipes/braces). (09-records)
77. Nested record value: brace value implies no `-` separator (`a { ... }`). (09-records)
78. Duplicate keys in same record `{ a - 1, a - 2 }`: error or last-one-wins. (09-records)
79. Records-in-params composition: legal, deferred fixture to combinations. (09-records)
80. Whitespace-separated items inside inline `[ ]`: single multi-word String item, not space-separated items. (10-collections)
81. Empty items between commas `[ , ]` / `[ a, , b ]`: error. (10-collections)
82. Newline-as-item-separator inside `[ ... ]` (parity with multi-line records). (10-collections)
83. Mixed structural shapes inside one collection: legal. (10-collections)

#### Data access (11)
84. Fuzzy-key canonical form: lowercase + split on whitespace/underscore/camel boundaries + space-joined. (11-data-access)
85. Spaces inside access path `@keeper.years at post`: single-token segment, words after become prose. (11-data-access)
86. Numeric-vs-named segment disambiguation: parent value-shape decides (collection→index, record→key). (11-data-access)
87. Chained access depth: unbounded; each non-terminal must yield a container. (11-data-access)
88. Container at terminal access position: resolution error (no canonical text form for record/collection). (11-data-access)
89. Acronym fuzzy-match edge (`HTTPSPort`): deferred. (11-data-access)

#### Conditionals (12)
90. `is` vs `equals` operators: exact synonyms for value-equality on scalars. (12-conditionals)
91. Truthy rule for bare-reference `(if @x)`: falsy = `Bool(false)` or missing/absent; `0`, `""`, `{}`, `[]` are truthy. (12-conditionals)
92. Missing-field-in-conditional suppressed-to-falsy (reconciles with I.11/M1-RECONCILIATIONS). (12-conditionals)
93. Empty `(if c) (end)` / `(else) (end)` body: legal no-op, no diagnostic. (12-conditionals)
94. Whitespace inside parens-keywords `( if ... )` vs `(if ...)`: keywords recognised only with tight opener. (12-conditionals)
95. Nested `(if)` classification: single block form, LIFO depth-based `(end)` pairing. (12-conditionals)
96. `(if ...)` positionally free: may open mid-paragraph as well as block-start. (12-conditionals)
97. Comparison strict-typed (no coercion): `Number(99) is String("99")` is type-mismatch error. (12-conditionals)

#### Iteration (13)
98. Loop variable shadowing inside `(each)` body: lexical shadowing wins; outer `#item` shadowed until `(end)`. (13-iteration)
99. Empty `(each ... as item) (end)` body: legal, no output per iteration. (13-iteration)
100. Iteration source-order preservation as a normative property. (13-iteration)
101. Loop variable scope: body-only; name reverts after `(end)`. (13-iteration)
102. Nested-each: lexical stacking of loop variables; inner wins on name collision. (13-iteration)
103. `(end)` LIFO pairing across mixed `(if)` / `(each)` nesting: untyped `(end)`. (13-iteration, 17-combinations)

#### Composition / references (14)
104. Cross-file forward references / global hoisting: affirm I.8 across the reference graph. (14-composition)
105. Path resolution: POSIX-style relative paths, leading `./` or `../`, bare or absolute paths forbidden. (14-composition)
106. Transitive reference visibility: graph fully flattened before expansion. (14-composition)
107. Self-reference handling: no-op via already-visited memoization. (14-composition)
108. Circular reference (length ≥ 2): unroll via memoization (cycles operationally indistinguishable from DAG). (14-composition)
109. Missing referenced file: hard error naming both referencing file and attempted path. (14-composition)
110. `reference` directive position: anywhere at top level (hoisting handles ordering). (14-composition)
111. Reference resolution walk order: depth-first, source order — normative for diagnostics. (14-composition)
112. Duplicate definitions across files: error unless `+#x` additive (parity with single-file redefinition). (14-composition)

#### Scripting (15)
113. Inline `<% expr %>` legal positions: anywhere a prose text run is legal; not inside structural keys/names. (15-scripting)
114. Script run ordering: strict document order, single top-to-bottom pass. (15-scripting)
115. `lh` bridge surface stability: frozen core seven methods; `lh.host.*` namespace for app extensions. (15-scripting)
116. `<% %>` content opacity: opaque bytes terminated by first `%>` outside JS string/template/regex state. (15-scripting)
117. Script errors: propagate as fatal diagnostic (no silent swallow). (15-scripting)
118. `@scriptCall` zero-arg form: empty parens required (`@scriptCall(foo)` is a call, not a ref). (15-scripting)

#### Combinations / cross-cuts (17)
119. Access path inside non-prose contexts (pipe values, conditional RHS, captures): uniform recognition. (17-combinations)
120. Resolution timing: definitions resolve at expansion site; iterated collections snapshot at iteration entry; pipe values evaluate eagerly at use-site. (17-combinations)
121. Emphasis tokenisation inside use-side block-form bodies: full prose grammar applies. (17-combinations)
122. `lh.inject` fragment parsing: injected bytes re-parsed as Wit (not byte-literal). (17-combinations)
123. Definition body re-resolved per expansion (not captured at definition site). (17-combinations)

#### Error model (DS-15 codes — from tests/errors)
124. Error codes enumerated: `E_UNCLOSED_NODE`, `E_MISMATCHED_CLOSE`, `E_UNCLOSED_COMMENT`, `E_UNCLOSED_PAREN`, `E_UNCLOSED_DEFINITION`, `E_EMPTY_PIPE`, `E_UNRESOLVED_REFERENCE`, `E_MISSING_FIELD`, `E_MISSING_REFERENCE_FILE`, `E_CIRCULAR_REFERENCE`, `E_PARTIAL_SHAPE_MISMATCH`, `E_BARE_FIELD`, `E_TYPE_MISMATCH`. (tests/errors)
125. Loc convention: opener-location for unclosed constructs; closer-location for mismatched closers; reference-site for unresolved references; field-name for missing-field. (tests/errors)

#### Integration-level confirmations
126. `(if ::param:: is X)` inside a definition body: deferred-evaluation, resolves at invocation. (integration/report.wit)
127. `@code` and similar nodes do not switch the parser grammar based on a `language` parameter — bodies parse uniformly. (integration/blog-post.wit)
128. `+#name:` accepts the full range of value shapes a `#name:` accepts (single-line, multi-line, record, collection). (integration/book-manuscript)
129. Parameter value runs to the next unescaped `|`; em-dashes, periods, ALL CAPS, parens-in-prose do not terminate. (integration/film-script.wit)
130. Use-side `!!` short-close — surfaced by M1.17 nested-nodes and script-injects fixtures (conflicts with M1.07 lean; see M1-RECONCILIATIONS). (17-combinations, 07-definitions)

## J. Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Spec ambiguity discovered late | High | M1 fixture pass forces ambiguities to surface before parser is written |
| `!!` greedy parse swallows prose | High | Restrict `!!` to specific contexts; document the rule |
| Bare-reference disambiguation | High | Require non-word boundary after `@name`; document the rule in spec |
| Parser performance under LSP demand | Medium | Profile in M3; consider incremental parsing in M5 |
| TextMate stub disagrees with parser | Low | Keep stub region-only; rely on LSP for tokens |
| Multi-file source maps lose origin | Medium | Locations always include `{ file, line, col }` |
| Versioning churn pre-1.0 | Medium | 0.x with explicit breaking-change notes |
| `<% %>` JS bleeds into Wit | Medium | Lex `<% %>` as opaque; parser doesn't enter JS |

## K. Operations

- **Build:** pnpm workspaces, TS strict, ESM only.
- **Test:** vitest, snapshot-based. `pnpm test`; `pnpm test --update` to refresh snapshots.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions on push. `pnpm install` → `pnpm typecheck` → `pnpm test` → `pnpm build`.
- **Versioning:** Changesets. Pre-1.0 = 0.x, breaking allowed. Spec PDF carries its own version that parser targets.
- **Publish:** npm on tag (packages); VSIX for extension; spec PDF in repo + docs site.
- **Docs:** spec PDF (canonical), `examples/` (narrative), `tests/fixtures/` (executable spec).
- **Telemetry:** none.
- **License:** MIT (pending confirmation).

## M. First concrete actions

1. Lock final decisions (license, package name, anything outstanding).
2. **Commit this `PLAN.md`.** ← we are here
3. M0 scaffold: root `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `tsconfig.json`, empty `packages/parser` with `ast.ts` stub, vitest config, CI workflow. One commit.
4. Begin M1: write fixture `.wit` files. Surface design questions; resolve open questions I.1–I.17.
5. End of M1: every fixture compiles in our heads; spec PDF v0.2; AST types finalized.

## N. Planning levels — how they map

```
User stories       describe what someone wants
   ↓
Dev stories        describe what we have to build
   ↓
TDD stories        describe what we test
   - Utility       pure functions, isolated tests, foundation
   - State         AST shapes, invariants, type safety
   - Composition   how units combine into pipelines
```

Tests run bottom-up: utility green first (easy, isolated), state green next (shapes correct), composition green last (pipeline integration). Failures climb the stack: a composition failure points back to a state or utility test that should be added.

## O. Living document

This file is the source of truth for *what* and *why*. As open questions resolve, the answers land here. As TDD stories surface mid-implementation, new rows append to G. As risks materialize or recede, J is updated. PRs that change behavior should cross-reference the dev story they implement.
